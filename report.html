    <h1>Technical Components</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>Your site must contain at least five separate pages, 
        each having a meaningful purpose. One of the files should be named index.html. 
        Your pages must link to each other in a logical and meaningful flow.
        <ul>
          <li>report.html does not count toward the five, but index.html does.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li class="answer">
        Our files are index.html, ourmission.html, features.html, community.html, and contact.html.
        These are all different meaningful files with unique content. The flow of web pages is accessed by
        the navigation bar. All files are in "chronological" order, and make sense in their placement.
      </li>

      <li>
        Each page must declare its favicon 
        (fine and possibly preferred to use the same one for all pages).
      </li>

      <li class="answer">
        All pages share the same "favicon." One can see this in the title/tab of each of the web pages.
        It's the "saturn-filled.png" that is found in our files.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your site must include some sort of header.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">
        Our header is our navigation at the top of all the webpages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your site must include some sort of navigation links.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">
        Our navigation links are at the top of the all the webpages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your site must support distinct layouts for large and small screens using media queries. 
        Use comments to note where you completed this activity. You may do this in a variety of ways. 
        Consider using this to control images or switching blocks between rows (for large screens) and columns (for small).
      </li>

      <li class="answer">
        Our site supports all sizes of screens. We used media queries to shrink all the different pictures of the background of our bodies.
        In the case of the navigation bar, we had to come up with a solution because it did not look good shrunken. Salman decided to add a
        drop down bar for mobile users to use for navigation.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your site must include images, and their alt attributes must adequately describe the image content to users of screen readers, 
        users with images disabled, and webcrawlers.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">Answer Here</li>

      <li>
        Each page and stylesheet of your site must validate without any warnings or errors using the Nu ValidatorLinks to an external site
        and WAVE Web Accessibility EvaluatorLinks to an external site.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">Answer Here</li>

      <li>
        Your site must use at least two different font faces. Headings are often rendered in a sans-serif font, and paragraph copy in a serif font.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">Answer Here</li>

      <li>
        Your site must include at least one form. The form need not do anything at this point in your learning, 
        but it must be present and it must use built-in content verification. Like all content, it must be neatly aligned.
      </li>

      <li class="answer">Answer Here</li>

      <li>
        Your site must include links to external sites.
      </li>

      <li>
        Your site must be available at https://yourusername or your partner's username.github.io/343-s23-p1
      </li>
